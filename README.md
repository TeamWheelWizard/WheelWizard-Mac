# Wheel Wizard on MacOS

## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard is a mod manager for Mario Kart Wii on Dolphin. It patches your game file to stay up to date with the Retro Rewind mod, which is currently the most popular mod used in online lobbies. To learn more, check out their [wiki](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind).

## Free and Open Source

While the Mac version is maintained and tested by [gdmagana](https://github.com/gdmagana), the original Wheel Wizard app was made by [patchzy](https://github.com/patchzyy) and [wanttobeeme](https://github.com/wanttobeeme). This application is completely free to use. For Windows/Linux, you can go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard/releases) and download the executable there. Once installed, the app will automatically notify you when updates are available.
