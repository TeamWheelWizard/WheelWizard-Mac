# Wheel Wizard on MacOS

## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard is a mod manager for Mario Kart Wii on the [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/). It patches your game file to stay up to date with the [Retro Rewind](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind) mod, which is currently the most popular mod used in online lobbies. This app also can be used to manage your own custom textures/mods, find [online lobbies](https://kevinvg207.github.io/rr-rooms/), keep track of your stats, settings, and more!

## Free and Open Source

While the Mac version is maintained and tested by [gdmagana](https://github.com/gdmagana), the original Wheel Wizard app was made by [patchzy](https://github.com/patchzyy) and [wanttobeeme](https://github.com/wanttobeeme). This application is completely free to use. For Windows/Linux, you can go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard/releases) and download the executable there. Once installed, the app will automatically notify you when updates are available.

## Usage Guide

### Prerequisites
- [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) (latest stable or development version)
