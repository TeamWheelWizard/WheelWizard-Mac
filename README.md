# Wheel Wizard on MacOS

## Mario Kart Mod Manager & Retro Rewind Auto Updater

Wheel Wizard is a mod manager for Mario Kart Wii on the [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/). It patches your game file to stay up to date with the [Retro Rewind](https://wiki.tockdom.com/wiki/Retro_Rewind) mod, which is currently the most popular mod used in online lobbies. This app also can be used to manage your own custom textures/mods, find [online lobbies](https://kevinvg207.github.io/rr-rooms/), keep track of your stats, settings, and more!

## Free and Open Source

While the Mac version is maintained and tested by [gdmagana](https://github.com/gdmagana), the original Wheel Wizard app was made by [patchzy](https://github.com/patchzyy) and [wanttobeeme](https://github.com/wanttobeeme). This application is completely free to use. For Windows/Linux, you can go to the [latest releases](https://github.com/TeamWheelWizard/WheelWizard/releases) and download the executable there. Once installed, the app will automatically notify you when updates are available.

Feel free to join our community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vZ7T2wJnsq) for support and discussions! If you see any bugs, this is also the place to be :P

## Download
Check the releases tab to download the Mac version. Either choose the version for your computer's architecture, or use the Universal build if you're unsure.

## Usage Guide

### Prerequisites
- [Dolphin Emulator](https://dolphin-emu.org/) (latest stable or development version)
- A legally obtained copy of Mario Kart Wii (RVZ, ISO, or WBFS format). Using RVZ is preferred since it takes up less space on your computer.
- A controller (recommended for better gameplay experience)

### Installation
1. Download the correct `WheelWizard-blahblahblah.dmg` file from the releases tab.
2. Open the `dmg` file and drag `WheelWizard` to your Applications folder.
3. Launch `WheelWizard` from your Applications folder. If macOS prevents it from opening, go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and allow the app to run.

### Setting Up WheelWizard
1. First, ensure Dolphin is downloaded and has been launched before at least once.
2. Open `WheelWizard` and select your **Dolphin Emulator** installation, if not detected automatically.
3. Browse and select your **Mario Kart Wii RVZ/ISO/WBFS** file.
4. Select the Config folder for Dolphin, if not detected automatically.

### Playing Mario Kart Wii with the Retro Rewind mod
1. Once the config is finished, you can launch the game via the play button on the main menu!
2. You can change many video settings through WheelWizard, but more options exist within the Dolphin app.
3. If you don't have a bluetooth adapter for your wii remote, you might want to try [WiiMote Pair](https://github.com/dolphin-emu/WiimotePair)
4. If your controller or audio settings aren't working right, try experimenting with the settings. You may need to enable Launch through Dolphin


### Getting your Mii in WheelWizard
1. To make a Mii, you need to first open Dolphin
2. In the menu bar, open **Tools / Load Wii System Menu** (or do **Perform Online System Update** first if this option is greyed out)
3. Launch Mario Kart Wii and make a license with your Mii
4. To get your friend code, connect to Retro WFC. It should show up in game and in Wheel Wizard

### Playing online
From the main menu, select Retro WFC for your desired amount of players. From there you can get your friend code, add friends, and join lobbies!

### Troubleshooting
- **Online play not working?** This may be with your network not allowing peer2peer connections. Try modifying your br
- **Performance issues?** Try lowering Dolphinâ€™s graphics settings or using a different backend (Metal/Vulkan/OpenGL).
